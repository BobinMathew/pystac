It is primarily a means\nto gain experience and expertise in automated data acquisition from the ISS,\nalthough it is expected to provide useful images for use in disaster\nmonitoring and assessment, and environmental decision making.\n\nFor more information about ISERV:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/servir/index.html\n\nFor more information about SERVIR:\nhttp://servirglobal.net\n\n## Format\n\nISERV data is provided in JPEG format for Level 0 products. Level 0 is\ngeoreferenced using the following coordinate system:\n`WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere`\n\nGeoTIFFs are provided by ISERV. Cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs are provided by\nRadiant Earth Foundation\n\n## Organization\n\nISERV is a true color image in JPEG format. Each band is delivered as a\ngrayscale, JPEG-compressed, 8-bit string of unsigned integers. Bands are not\ncalibrated. Accompanying each image is an XML auxiliary file, a JGW (\"world\")\nfile that provides image location and geometry information, and an OVR\noverview file containing the reduced resolution image pyramid for ease of use\nin image processing software.\n\n### Data File Names\n\nThe file naming convention for ISERV L-0 data is as follows:\n\n`IP0YYMMDDhhmmssLATLON.JPG` where:\n\n* `IP` - ISERV Pathfinder\n* `0` - Processing level\n* `YY` - two-numeral year\n* `MM` - two-numeral month\n* `DD` - two-numeral day\n* `hh` - two-numeral hour\n* `mm` - two-numeral minute\n* `ss` - two-numeral second\n* `LAT` - four-numeral latitude in decimal degrees plus hemispherical indicator\n  (`N` or `S`)\n* `LON` - five-numeral longitude in decimal degrees plus hemispherical\n  indicator (`E` or `W`)\n\nExample: `IP01306111234561234N12345W.jpg`\n\n`LON` is always 5 characters -- 3 left of decimal, 2 right of decimal, plus a\ncardinal direction indicator\n\n`123.45W` (or `-123.45`) becomes `12345W`\n\n`23.45E` becomes `02345E`\n\n`5.5E` becomes `00550E`\n \n`LAT` is always 4 characters -- 2 left of decimal, 2 right of decimal, plus a\ncardinal direction indicator\n\n`34.56S` (or `-34.56`) becomes `3456S`\n\n`4.56N` becomes `0456N`\n\n`6.6S` becomes `0660S`\n\n### READING DATA\n\nAny image display software can open the JPEG image files. \nNo software is included on this product for viewing ISERV data.\n\n## General Information and Documentation\n\n### ISERV data access\n\nUSGS EarthExplorer at https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov\n\n### Data restrictions\n\nThis is an experimental product derived from the ISERV Pathfinder system.\nData and metadata files may be freely distributed without restriction.\n\n### Credits\n\nISERV, NASA\n\n### Level 0 Data Processing Levels\n\nReconstructed, unprocessed ISERV instrument data at full resolution in JPEG\nformat, with all communications artifacts (e.g., synchronization frames,\ncommunications headers, duplicate data) removed. Images are geolocated using\na custom-built, automated georeferencing process which provides an average\npositional accuracy of approximately 2km.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nAny use of trade, product, or firm names is for descriptive purposes only and\ndoes not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.\n", "extent": {"spatial": [-180, -90, 180, 90], "temporal": ["2013-03-27T14:18:28Z", "2014-11-27T11:56:49Z"]}, "license": "PDDL-1.0", "title": "", "links": [{"rel": "root", "href": "https://iserv-stac.s3.amazonaws.com/0.6.1/catalog.json"}, {"rel": "self", "href": "https://iserv-stac.s3.amazonaws.com/0.6.1/catalog.json"}, {"rel": "child", "href": "2013/catalog.json"}, {"rel": "child", "href": "2014/catalog.json"}]}
